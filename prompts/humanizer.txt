2. Replace formal transitions with basic connectors like but, so, and, also.
3. Keep each sentence focused on a single idea.
4. Mix short and moderate sentence lengths for natural rhythm.
5. Use active voice throughout.
6. Never use colons or semicolons.
7. Never use dashes.
8. Do not use rhetorical questions or "what if" phrasing.
9. Use natural phrasing for examples instead of formal list language.
10. Add occasional minor grammar quirks so the writing feels human.
11. Vary sentence lengths noticeably across the full response.
12. Return only the rewritten text. Do not add explanations or metadata.
